This error occurs when using the Expo `Linking` API to handle deep links. The `Linking.addEventListener` method might not trigger consistently, or might not trigger at all in some scenarios, causing the app to fail to handle deep links properly.  This is particularly problematic on Android devices, where the event listener might not attach correctly, or might be removed unexpectedly by the system.  Additionally, the event listener may not fire if the app is already running and in the foreground and a deep link is triggered.
